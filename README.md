Selenium Composer is a simple tool, which setup a local grid under windows and ubuntu. It get the actual selenium server with matching drivers for edge, ie11, chrome and firefox. 

You can start and stop single selenium nodes.

Under windows: 
For installing java chrome and firefox you need administrator rights. Normaly you should get a UAC Dialog.

Under Linux:
You must start seleniumComposer over the shell.
If you install java chrome and firefox over the composer, you get the password question over the terminal from where seleniumComposer starts.

* If you have grid timeout exception look out for compatibility between selenium version and browser version btw driver version.

normaly it should be work :)
